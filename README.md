# Preface
=================
Many supplier I have met, especially for those who never tried this platform before, had some trouble managing their stores.
To make it easier with fewer steps and more tips to bootstrap, I made an idea to create this project.
Thanks to the official APIs and great open-source frameworks, it is now possible to make the dream come true.
